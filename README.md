## Fork infos

This is my fork of [mikeflynn/kali-docker](https://github.com/mikeflynn/kali-docker). Feel free to fork the original or this version for yourself.
I didn't like the idea of using Make to start my "hacker" session, so I rewrote the Makefile to a shell script with pretty much the same functionality.

The follow features were added over time:

- X11 socket mapping to start gui "natively"
- vnc function to access the docker container within a browser
- popular security related repos
- popular hacking tools (from packet manager and github)
- function/alias to help and speed up daily hacking tasks
- easier integration for configuration files of your linux daily driver

## Docker

The prebuild image is also available on dockerhub:

```bash
docker pull braunbearded/kali-docker:latest
```

The image is quite big so keep that in mind.

# Original (updated)

I wasn't satisfied with any of the existing Kali Docker setups, so I made my own that has a more efficient Dockerfile and a custom set of software.

If there are cool apps that make sense to add to this, please submit a pull request so we can have the best possible subset of apps for people to spin up and use via Docker.

## Prerequisites

1. Docker.
2. The knowledge of what to do with Kali.

## How to Start

```bash
> cd ./kali-docker
> ./kali.sh up
...
> ./kali.sh shell
```

Once the container is built and running you will are attached to a shell within docker.

## Help

```bash
> ./kali.sh help
help     Show this help message
shell    Open shell in kali container
up:      Start kali container
build:   Build kali image and start container
stop:    Stop kali container
clean:   Stop and remove kali containers
```

## How to Add Apps

Once in the Kali shell you can add them as you normally would with `apt install ...`, but if you want the apps already in place upon rebuild you can edit the Dockerfile to include whatever app you'd like.

## Configuration files

If you need some ideas on how to customize this docker container have a look at my [hacking-handbook](https://github.com/braunbearded/hacking-handbook).
It not only includes documentation for often used programs in hacking but also some nice aliases and functions to speed stuff up.
See docker-compose.override.yml to integrate [hacking-handbook](https://github.com/braunbearded/hacking-handbook) in this container.
